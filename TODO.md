# Car Racing Game - Implementation Progress

## Development Steps

- [ ] 1. Create Next.js layout and main page structure
- [ ] 2. Implement core game engine with physics and entity system
- [ ] 3. Add player car controls and movement
- [ ] 4. Implement AI cars with different behaviors
- [ ] 5. Create track system with boundaries and checkpoints
- [ ] 6. Add power-up system (speed boost, shield, bonus points)
- [ ] 7. Implement collision detection and physics
- [ ] 8. Create HUD system with real-time stats
- [ ] 9. Add audio system with sound effects and music
- [ ] 10. Implement game states (menu, playing, paused, game over)
- [ ] 11. Add mobile touch controls
- [ ] 12. Install dependencies
- [ ] 13. **AUTOMATIC**: Process placeholder images (placehold.co URLs) → AI-generated images
  - This step executes automatically when placeholders are detected
  - No manual action required - system triggers automatically
  - Ensures all images are ready before testing
- [ ] 14. Build application
- [ ] 15. Start server and test gameplay
- [ ] 16. API testing (if applicable)
- [ ] 17. Final testing and optimization

## Game Features Checklist

- [ ] Top-down 2D racing view
- [ ] Realistic car physics (acceleration, friction, turning)
- [ ] 5 AI opponents with different behaviors
- [ ] 3-lap race system with checkpoints
- [ ] Power-ups: Speed boost, shield, bonus points
- [ ] Real-time HUD: speed, position, lap time, boost status
- [ ] Audio: engine sounds, collisions, power-ups, background music
- [ ] Cross-platform controls: keyboard + touch
- [ ] Game states: menu → racing → paused → game over
- [ ] Performance: 60fps target with optimizations
